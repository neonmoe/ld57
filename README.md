# Diving for Oxygen

A short colony simulator where you try to lead your little divers to productive
ends, like producing energy and oxygen, so that they can keep breathing.

This game was made as a demonstration of using the prototype game engine I made
as part of my Master's thesis, which can be found here:
<https://github.com/pcjens/rust-game-engine-prototype>

Mind the code quality if you decide to delve in â€” it was written for a 72 hour
game jam.
